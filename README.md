# Welcome to my-config

This repository aim to store and share my configuration, iterm, bitbar, aliases, tools, ideas...

Anything that makes me more comfortable or productive on a daily basis

## Kaizen

This is an forever iterating configuration and by so git seems the more natural to use.

I did not start my setup by thinking about sharing it, or storing it into git, so it might not be `plug-and-play`.

I'll also have to deal with sensitive informations, like tokens or private hosts, not usually a concern when the configuration stays private.

Ideal would be store them into keychain and interact with keychain directly from terminal, not tried not lookup, we'll see.

## Structure

This repository will follow a tree structure to group configuration as much as possible.

Symlinks or app configuration should be changed to store configuration at the expected location.

The following structure will be followed as a starting point :

- root - contains setup scripts / documentation

  - tools directory

    - main configuration

    - dedicated tab / sub tool configuration

As an example for Alfred :

- Alfred3
  - General configuration
  - Plugins
  - Snippets
  - ...

## Iterm

### Oh-My-Zsh

### .zshrc

### Aliases

## Alfred

### Plugins

### Snippets

## Bitbar plugins

## Brew
